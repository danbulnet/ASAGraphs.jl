# ASA-graphs
ASA-graphs are self-balancing, aggregating, and sorting tree-like data structures for efficient data representation.
They can be used in various places, such as data structures, databases, and data mining / machine learning systems.
These graphs are often smaller and use more efficient algorithms for searching, inserting, and removing data than the most commonly used self-balancing trees, e.g. B-trees, Red-Black-trees or AVL-trees. 
ASA-graphs automatically aggregate and count all duplicates of values and represent them by the same nodes, connecting them in order, and simultaneously providing very fast data access based on a binary search tree approach. It combines the advantages of sorted lists, binary search trees, B-trees, and B+trees, eliminating their weaknesses.
